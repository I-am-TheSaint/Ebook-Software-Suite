# Ebook-Software-Suite
A suite of complimentary programs to be used with ebooks.

Generally these programs are used in the following loose order, and all are created with AutoIt. Some are optional or only related to others.

(1) KindEbook Wishlist

(2) KoboChecker (optional)

(3) Bucket-for-URLs (optional)

(4) Fix Author Names (optional)

(5) AZWPlug

(6) Add Ebook To Calibre (optional)

(7) UpdateFromOPF

(8) AddImageToEpub (optional)

(9) Batch Ebook Convert

(10) Batch ZipIt (optional)

(11) Add Book & All Formats To Calibre (optional)

You use one or more of the above, along with programs like Kindle4PC, Adobe Digital Editions and Calibre, and various Calibre plugins.

If you just purchase Kindle Ebooks, then you would only use (1), maybe (3), (5), (7), maybe (8), (9), maybe (10) and or (11).

If you just purchase Kobo ebooks, then you would just use (2), maybe (3), maybe (4), (6), maybe (8), maybe (9), maybe (10) and or (11).

Some of the Kobo related programs are suitable for other EPUB sources, such as Google Books etc.

If an ebook has DRM, then it will be down to using related Calibre plugins, at user discretion, to enable using some of the programs.

An optional program may or may not be required, depending on desire or need etc.

Many of the programs have earlier versions, screenshots and information at the AutoIt Forum.
